## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of an **undergraduate thesis (skripsi)** to fulfill the graduation requirements for a bachelor's degree. The research aims to develop and introduce a novel anomaly detection procedure on accounting journal entry data by combining autoencoder and Benford's first digit analysis.

This project is greatly inspired by the [work](https://github.com/GitiHubi/deepAI) of Marco Schreyer and Timur Sattarov, as well as the works of Mark Nigrini.
